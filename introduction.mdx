## What is Entropi?

**Entropi** is an AI-powered API that extracts product information from mobile screenshots. Simply upload a screenshot of a product (from Instagram, TikTok, e-commerce sites, etc.), and Entropi will:

- **Extract** product details (name, price, description, merchant)
- **Crop** the product image intelligently
- **Enrich** data with web scraping and search
- **Store** everything in a structured database

## Key Features
